# Rest-proj
A project from a online course i am working on to expand my REST api skills and also implement some spring security feutures 

I will very soon "dockerize" the project so its easieier to run it without having the usual database connection problems 

To have access to the endpoints the user must first register and login and after include the provided bearer token in the next requests to have access to the endpoints
